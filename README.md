# XNpaus-Portfolio

## Project Description

Welcome! XNpaus Portfolio is a project that I would like to get personal with. This project challenged me to see if I can implement bootstrap into a website that I create about me. There's certain elements that I had to incorporate into the website, like making a navigation bar and having a link take me to another webpage. I also learned how to use columns and grids to make my bio card.

## Development

The development process was trully hard for me in this project, especially making sure that the web page was responsive. I had many hours just sitting at my computer learning how to make a sticky footer and how to align all my items into each additional page. Here is a snip it of my development process. 

<b> Here is the first draft of my website.</b>
